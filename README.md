- **Actions:**  
  [addTransaction](cci:1://file:///Users/sarthakatrish/Desktop/MoneyMap/src/context/FinanceContext.jsx:49:2-52:3), [removeTransaction](cci:1://file:///Users/sarthakatrish/Desktop/MoneyMap/src/context/FinanceContext.jsx:70:2-73:3), [setBudgetForCategory](cci:1://file:///Users/sarthakatrish/Desktop/MoneyMap/src/context/FinanceContext.jsx:53:2-64:3), [addCategory](cci:1://file:///Users/sarthakatrish/Desktop/MoneyMap/src/context/FinanceContext.jsx:65:2-68:3), `removeBudgetForCategory`, `removeCategory`.

  Components update instantly on any data change.
